# Tailwinds Sandbox
Demo project showcasing the capabilities of tailwinds with React.

## Package Manager
https://pnpm.io/installation
`wget -qO- https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | ENV="~/.bashrc" SHELL="$(which bash)" bash -`
`pnpm install`

## Git Tag
`git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Basic Template, Vite, Tailwinds, DaisyUI"`  

Sharing Tags

By default, the git push command doesn’t transfer tags to remote servers. You will have to explicitly push tags to a shared server after you have created them. This process is just like sharing remote branches — you can run git push origin <tagname>.

$ git push origin --tags  
Push many tags
